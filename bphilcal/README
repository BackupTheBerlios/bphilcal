BPhilCal is a tiny server script written in PHP
for rendering a personalised concert calendar
for concert subscribers of the
Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra (BPO; Sir Simon Rattle)

The user basically enters the alphabetical letters of his subscriptions
such as "AEG" into an input form. The script then retrieves the
concert information for subscription series A, E, G from the public
available webpages of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and
presents all concerts in chronologically sorted order.

Additional features:

*	it detects and indicates "doublures", where a certain concert
	is part of two or more subscribed series

*	allows the user to select different output formats
	short - medium - long
	(the short format giving information one concert per line)

*	renders conductor, componists/artist as links to www.wikipedia.org
	depending on the chosen language to give quick information on demand

*	links subscription letter and day to the corresponding web pages
	of the Berlin Phliharmonic Orchestra (BPO)
